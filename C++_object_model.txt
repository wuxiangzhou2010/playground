* C versus C++

* Data Hiding
    access specifiers(public, protected, private)
    protected:they can be accessed in child classes which are called derived classes
* Inheritance 
    class derived-class: access-specifier base-class (access-specifier: private by default)
* Polymorphism(means having many forms. Typically, polymorphism occurs when there is a hierarchy of classes and they are related by inheritance.)
    (a call to a member function will cause a different function to be executed depending on the type of object that invokes the function)
    (Defining in a base class a virtual function, with another version in a derived class, signals to the compiler that we don't want static linkage for this function.)
    early binding/late binding/dynamic linkage/static linkage/virtual/
     pure virtual function (  virtual int area() = 0;)
* Overloading (allows you to specify more than one definition for a function name or an operator in the same scope, which is called function overloading and operator overloading respectively. function overloading->types and/or the number of arguments)(overload resolution)

This pointer:
    this pointer is the pointer to the object itself
Pointer to Class:
A pointer to a C++ class is done exactly the same way as a pointer to a structure and to access members of a pointer to a class you use the member access operator -> operator, just as you do with pointers to structures. Also as with all pointers, you must initialize the pointer before using it.
constructor
destructor
static member:
static function member:(
    1. A static member function can only access static data member, other static member functions and any other functions from outside the class.
    2. static member functions have a class scope and they do not have access to the this pointer of the class. )
    
    
    Data Abstraction
    Data Encapsulation( data hiding)
file stream
error/exception handling
    (Exceptions provide a way to transfer control from one part of a program to another. )
    try/catch/throw/
Dynamic memory:
    stack/heap
    
Multiprocess/MultiThreading
Web Programming
